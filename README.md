# Person-detection
In this project, I use the thermal camera Adafruit AMG8833 to record temperature data of the environement. For visualization purposes, I display these images on a low level OLED display. After acquiring this heatmap data, I send it to a computer using the UART cable or wireless communication for processing. The processing algorithm is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to identify the shape of a person. This person detection ability is then used to do people counting and hopefully measure the distance between people. This device could be used to check and enforce social distancing to help contain the spread of covid-19.
